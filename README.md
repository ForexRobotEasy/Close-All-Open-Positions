## Functionality
The program consists of several functions and event handlers that work together to achieve the desired result. Here is an overview of how it works:

1. The `CloseAllOpenPositions()` function is responsible for closing all open positions in the trading account. It uses the `PositionsTotal()` function to get the total number of open positions.

2. A loop is then used to iterate through each open position. Inside the loop, the position ticket number is obtained using the `PositionGetTicket()` function.

3. The position is then closed using the `PositionClose()` function. If the position cannot be closed, an error message is printed. Otherwise, a success message is printed.

4. The `OnButtonClick()` event handler is triggered when the user clicks a button on the software's user interface. It calls the `CloseAllOpenPositions()` function to initiate the closing of all open positions.

5. The `OnInit()` function is the entry point of the program. It creates a button on the user interface using the `ButtonCreate()` function and sets the button's click event handler using the `ButtonSetOnClick()` function.

6. The `OnTick()` function is the main program loop. It is empty in this code as there is no specific functionality required to be executed repeatedly.

7. The `OnDeinit()` function is triggered when the program is terminated. It removes the button from the user interface using the `ButtonRemove()` function.
